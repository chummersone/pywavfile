wavfile
=======

A lightweight package to read/write wave audio files to/from lists of
native Python types.

The package currently supports PCM (integer) and IEEE float formats, and
supports arbitrary integer precision, including: 16-, 24-, 32-, and
64-bit samples.

View online documentation at https://pywavfile.readthedocs.io/.

Usage: reading wave files
-------------------------

The package provides |wavfile.open| to open audio files for reading and
writing. For reading::

   f = wavfile.open(file, 'r')

where ``file`` is either a path to a wave file or a pointer to an open
file. This returns a |WavRead| object with the following properties:

|num_channels|
  The number of audio channels in the stream.

|sample_rate|
  The sampling rate/frequency of the audio stream.

|bits_per_sample|
  The number of bits per audio sample.

|num_frames|
  The total number of audio frames in the audio stream. A frame is a
  block of samples, one for each channel, corresponding to a single
  sampling point.

|duration|
  The duration of the audio file in seconds.

|hms|
  The duration of the audio file formatted as hh:mm:ss.tt.

|format|
  The file audio sample format.

|metadata|
  A dictionary containing metadata encoded in the file.

The object also has the following methods:

|readN|
  Read, at most, ``N`` frames from the audio stream in their unmodified
  native format. The method returns a list of lists with size
  ``(N,C)``, where ``C`` is the number of audio channels. Excluding
  ``N``, choosing ``N = None`` or ``N < 0`` will read all remaining
  samples.

|read_intN|
  This method is identical to |read| except that it returns the samples
  as integers using the specified bit depth.

|read_floatN|
  This method is identical to |read| except that it returns the samples
  as floats in the range [-1, 1).

|iterN|
  Similar to |read| but used in iterator contexts to read successive
  groups of audio frames.

|iter_intN|
  Similar to |read_int| but used in iterator contexts to read successive
  groups of audio frames.


|iter_floatN|
  Similar to |read_float| but used in iterator contexts to read
  successive groups of audio frames.

|seekN|
  Move to the ``N``\ th frame in the audio stream; ``whence`` sets the
  positioning: 0 (default) = absolute positioning, 1 = relative to
  current position, 2 = relative to end of last frame.

|tell|
  Return the current frame in the audio stream.

|close|
  Close the instance.

Alternatively, the |wavfile.read| shortcut function is provided::

   audio, sample_rate, bits_per_sample = wavfile.read(file, fmt='int')

where ``fmt`` is ``'int'``, ``'float'``, or ``'native'``; and ``audio``
is the audio data. The function reads all audio data in the file.

Usage: writing wave files
-------------------------

::

   f = wavfile.open(file, 'w',
                    sample_rate=44100,
                    num_channels=None,
                    bits_per_sample=16,
                    fmt=wavfile.chunk.WavFormat.PCM)

where ``sample_rate`` is the sampling rate for the new file,
``num_channels`` is the number of audio channels, ``bits_per_sample`` is
the number of bits used to encode each sample, and ``fmt`` is the audio
sample format. If ``num_channels`` is unspecified it will be determined
automatically from the first block of samples that are written (see
below). This returns a |WavWrite| object. The object shares its
properties with the |WavRead| class. The object also offers the same
|seek|, |tell|, and |close| methods. In addition, the following methods
are provided for writing audio data:

|write|
  Write frames of audio data to the audio file. The data should be
  contained in a list of lists with size ``(N,C)``, where ``N`` is the
  number of frames and ``C`` is the number of audio channels. The data
  may be ``int`` or ``float``. The data may be converted if they do
  match the format of the destination file.

|write_int|
  Write frames of integer audio data to the audio file. The data may be
  converted if they do match the format of the destination file.

|write_float|
  Write frames of float audio data to the audio file. The data may be
  converted if they do match the format of the destination file.

|add_metadata|
  Add metadata to the .wav file.

Alternatively, the |wavfile.write| shortcut function is provided::

   wavfile.write(file,
                 audio,
                 sample_rate=44100,
                 bits_per_sample=16,
                 fmt=wavfile.chunk.WavFormat.PCM,
                 metadata=None)

where ``audio`` is the audio data to write to the file.
